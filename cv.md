## About me:
Now I am a student at BSU. I want to take RSschool course in order to raise my skills and get a job as a Junior Web Developer. I try to make effort to study at the university and therefore I do not know if I can combine RSschool with study, but I will try, because I think that the university is not able to provide what is needed for work. 

## Skills:
  * HTML
  * CSS

}
```
